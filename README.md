Using a ESP32 board, control relays to turn a fridge (or anything, really) on and off based on sensor input. Uses temperature with deadband. Sends to LoRa for receiving and on-sending to the Internet. See BridgeBlob for the LoRa-WiFi bridge.

Requirements:
- ESP32 (tested on TTGO Lora 2.6)
- Arduino libraries
- esp32blobs library
